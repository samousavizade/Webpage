Unsupervised learning algorithms can learn patterns from that matrix $X$, such as whether or not it has hierarchical clusters. Supervised learning techniques, on the other hand, require that the rows in $X$ be associated with an array of labels or values $y$, so that those labels or values may be predicted on unseen feature samples.

        "One of the most common errors in financial research is taking some data, running it through an ML algorithm, backtesting the predictions, and repeating the process until a nice-looking backtest appears. Such pseudo-discoveries abound in academic journals, and even significant hedge funds are prone to falling into this trap. It makes no difference if the backtest is an out-of-sample walk-forward. The fact that we are repeating a test on the same data will almost certainly result in a  discovery. This methodological error is so well-known among statisticians that the American Statistical Association warns against it in its ethical guidelines (American Statistical Association [2016], Discussion #4). It usually takes around 20 iterations to find a () investment strategy with a standard significance level ( positive rate) of 5%.",
