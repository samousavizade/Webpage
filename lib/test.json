Such pseudo-discoveries abound in academic journals, and even significant hedge funds are prone to falling into this trap. It makes no difference if the backtest is an out-of-sample walk-forward. The fact that we are repeating a test on the same data will almost certainly result in a  discovery. This methodological error is so well-known among statisticians that the American Statistical Association warns against it in its ethical guidelines (American Statistical Association [2016], Discussion #4). It usually takes around 20 iterations to find a () investment strategy with a standard significance level ( positive rate) of 5%.",
